               Hello everyone! My name is Relic374. I've loved RPGs for so long,
               especially JRPGs for retro consoles such as the NES, SNES, Sega
               Genesis, and GameBoy. Theres just something about the music,
               story telling, characters, and excrusiatingly difficult battles
               that captivates me. Therefore, I've decided to create this
               website! I hope you'll enjoy you're stay and maybe learn something
               a long the way... Anyway, I hope you like my website. Feel free
               to contact me over on discord (username at the bottom of this
               page.) But please do not send me stupid shit like porno or
               unwarrented solicitation. I don't expect this to be a problem
               since no one knows about this website, but just note you'll be
               blocked.
          </p>

          <p class="second_p">
               The creating of this website was powered by MegaDeth, Alice in
               Chains, my good friend

               Discord Server, Final Fantasy 4, and an empowering love for
               Square Enix (Amano is king!!!)
